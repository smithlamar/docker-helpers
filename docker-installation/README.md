### Install Docker on linux (tested with Ubuntu)

This option is for those who don't want to use docker desktop and instead prefer running with linux or linux running on a vm). Much of this was
 borrowed from https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04 and the official Docker website but condensed into set and forget
  script form.


Run: the script _docker-helpers/docker-installation/docker-init-ubuntu.sh_ from your bash user home "~" directory.

! This will not work if run from Git Bash/Cygwin on Windows. It also likely wont work on Mac. It needs to be from a linux os (or VM)
